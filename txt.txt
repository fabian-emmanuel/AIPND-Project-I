Counts Computed from the Results dictionary for input into the Results Statistics dictionary:
Z: Number of Images
length of results_dic, because filenames = key
A: Number of Correct Dog matches
Both labels are of dogs: results_dic[key][3] = 1 and results_dic[key][4] = 1
B: Number of Dog Images
Pet Label is a dog: results_dic[key][3] = 1
C: Number of Correct Non-Dog matches
Both labels are NOT of dogs: results_dic[key][3] = 0 and results_dic[key][4] = 0
D: Number of Not Dog Images
number images - number dog images --OR--
Pet Label is NOT a dog: results_dic[key][3] = 0
E: Number of Correct Breed matches
Pet Label is a dog & Labels match: results_dic[key][3] = 1 and results_dic[key][2] = 1
(Optional) Y: Number of label matches
Labels match: results_dic[key][2] = 1
Compute a Summary of the Percentages from the Results Statistics dictionary counts:
Objective _1_a: Percentage of Correctly Classified Dog Images

A Correctly classified dog images.
B Number of dog images
Percentage of correctly classified "dog" images: A/B * 100
Objective _1_b: Percentage of Correctly Classified Non-Dog Images

C Correctly classified NOT a dog images.
D Number of NOT a dog images
Percentage of correctly classified "Non-dog" images: C/D * 100
Objective _2_: Percentage of Correctly Classified Dog Breeds

E Correctly classified as a particular breed of dog images.
B Number of dog images
Percentage of correctly classified Dog Breed images: E/B * 100
(Optional): Percentage Label Matches ( regardless if they're a dog)

Y Number of label matches
Z Number of images
Percentage of correctly Matched Images ( regardless if they are a dog): Y/Z * 100
Important Notes:

You will need to initialize all the counts to a value of zero before iterating through results dictionary. As you iterate through results dictionary, if certain criterion are met you will need to increment these counters by 1.
The percentages (and total number of images) can be generated from the counts (see percentage & count calculations above); therefore, these values should be calculated after counts have been calculated by iterating through the results dictionary.
When calculating the percentage of correctly classified Non-Dog Images, use a conditional statement to check that D, the number of "not-a-dog" images, is greater than zero. To avoid division by zero error, only if D is greater than zero should C/D be computed; otherwise, this should be set to 0.
Because the Results Statistics dictionary is created inside of the function and is a mutable object, you will need to return it's value at the end of the function (see section Mutable Data Types and Functions).
